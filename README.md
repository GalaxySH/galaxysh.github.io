# Home
This is the personal development reference of GalaxySH (myself). This repository is about learning and creating interesting and useful things. As long as I walk out of here with more than when I came in, I mean with what I accomplished (even if I didn't). If you're looking to find the home of EnigmaDigm Holdings, click [here](https://enigmadigm.com).

At the moment I am putting most of my time and resources in working on EnigmaDigm. EnigmaDigm is all over the place really, it has many uses and all kinds of different functions; from Discord bots to the latest [news](https://enigmadigm.com/news/). Now I don't plan on stopping there, I want to expand it as much as possible while working on improving what's already there. Right now I just need to get it out there, so EnigmaDigm will actually be put to some use.

If you are willing to help spread EnigmaDigm, please do so (would be nice if you would tell me for credit though). And if you want to become a part of the project in any way (including doing nothing), reference the sections below.

## Involvement

I would _love_ to hear any ideas for projects/fixes/whatever from anyone who reads this, so please contact me [here](https://enigmadigm.com/?conresrec=reset), or create a new issue.

## Explore

Believe it or not, it isn't just this page here, there's more, and I want you to see it (most of it anyways). You can go to [my account](https://github.com/GalaxySH) and start there, or you can start [here](https://galaxysh.github.io/GreenMesa). That goes to GreenMesa, by the way, that's one of the Discord bots I was talking about (you should start there because it needs more to it and I think you can help).

## Who's involved in this?

It's not just me, there's more. Really, this is EnigmaDigm speaking, not just GalaxySH. We're a team, building something(s) great. I'm not going to reveal identities here (though you could probably find out who I am easily), but I wanted you to know that these projects aren't lonesome and being pointlessly worked on by one person.

## The Future

Yeah, we're working on that.
