# GalaxySH
This is the personal project of GalaxySH. This repository is about learning and creating interesting and useful things. As long as I walk out of here with more than when I came in, I mean with what I accomplished (even if I didn't).

At the moment I am putting most of my time and resources in working on EnigmaDigm. EnigmaDigm is all over the place really, it has many uses and all kinds of different functions; from Discord bots to the latest [news](https://enigmadigm.com/news/). Now I don't plan on stopping there, I want to expand it as much as possible while working on improving what's already there. Right now I just need to get it out there, so EnigmaDigm will actually be put to some use.

If you are willing to help spread EnigmaDigm, please do so (would be nice if you would tell me for credit though). And if you want to become a part of the project in any way (including doing nothing), reference the sections below.

## Involvement

I would _love_ to hear any ideas for projects/fixes/whatever from anyone who reads this, so please contact me [here](https://enigmadigm.com/?conresrec=reset), or create a new issue.
